<h1 id="appendix-amendments-to-the-student-senate-bylaws">Appendix: Amendments to the Student Senate Bylaws</h1>
<p><em>Note: In September 2009 the Amendment procedure for the Student Senate Bylaws was changed to require that amendments be kept as an appendix to these bylaws. A partial list of amendments from March 19th, 1998 onward was available, and so it has also been included in this appendix. In April 2010 major revisions to the Student Senate Bylaws were approved by Student Senate, effectively replacing the old document with a new set of bylaws, and a separate document detailing Student Senate Fiscal Policy. The details of these changes are not included in this appendix, but all changes made to this document after the major revisions are recorded in this appendix.</em></p>
