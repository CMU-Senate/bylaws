    -  Amended the amendment procedure:
        -  XI.A changed from ‘Proposed amendments to these Bylaws must be submitted in writing to the Student Senate at a regular meeting of Student Senate’ to ‘To be considered for approval, an amendment to these Bylaws must be presented in writing at a regular meeting of Student Senate.’
        -  Removed requirement that ExComm makes a recommendation on proposed amendments.
        -  Weakened timing constraints: used to require that the proposed amendment be voted upon at the next regular meeting of Senate (with a 2/3 vote).
