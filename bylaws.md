                    (A)  No candidate may be ranked repeatedly, and no two candidates may be ranked equally.
                    (#)  A voter may rank as many or as few candidates as they would like.
                    (#)  A voter may elect to designate "No Confidence" at any rank.
                (#)  A number of votes needed to elect a candidate shall be established, and referred to as the _election threshold_. The election threshold shall be calculated using the Droop quota. For a definition of this quota, please see Appendix A to this document.
                (#)  In each round of the election, vote counting shall start with the tabulation of each voter's preferred candidate, of the candidates remaining. These remaining candidates will from here on referred to as _active candidates_.
                (#)  If there are candidates whose vote totals meet or exceed the election threshold, those candidates are considered elected. Votes exceeding the threshold are considered the candidate's _surplus votes_. If there are no remaining vacant seats, the election is complete. Otherwise, the election continues.
                (#)  For each elected candidate from subsection IV, their vote surplus shall be redistributed in the following procedure:
                    (A)  The fractional value of each vote to be redistributed is calculated by dividing the number of surplus votes for the candidate by the total votes received by said candidate.
                    (#)  This fractional value will then be applied to each ballot for the elected candidate, and each of these tabulated fractional ballots are transferred to the next active candidate ranked, or discarded if the ballot is contains no more active candidates. Such a ballot containing no more active candidates will then on be referred to as an _exhausted ballot_.
                    (#)  Following the redistribution of surplus votes, the process of counting votes and distributing surplus votes of any winning candidates, as described in subsections II through V above, is repeated. If no surplus votes were redistributed, the election shall proceed to subsection VI below.
                (#)  The candidate with the least number of votes shall be removed from the election, and referred to from here on as an _eliminated candidate_.

                    (A)  If there is a tie as to the candidate with the least number of votes, the entire tied set shall be eliminated if their combined vote count is less than that of the next-highest candidate.
                    (#)  If there is a tie as to the candidate with the least number of votes, and the above does not apply, the candidate with the least number of votes in the previous round shall be eliminated.
                    (#)  If there is still a tie, the procedure described in subsection B. above is repeated for the next-preceding round until the tie is broken.
                    (#)  If this was the first round of voting, or the above conditions do not apply in the case of a tie for the candidate to be eliminated, then the candidate in the tie with the smaller number of next-choice preferences (i.e. second-choice in the current round of counting) shall be eliminated. Should this also be a tie, this process will continue down the list of preferences until one candidate has a larger number of votes in a certain preference level.
                    (#)  If at the end of these steps a break in the tie of candidate with the least number of votes cannot be broken, then the facilitator of the election shall refer to the random elimination ordering. The candidate whose AndrewID's first character appears first according to the random elimination ordering shall be eliminated from the election. If there is more than one candidate with this character appearing first in their AndrewID, the candidate eliminated will be determined by the first distinct character in their AndrewID, with the character appearing first in the random elimination ordering signaling the candidate to be eliminated. The eliminated candidate's ballots shall be redistributed among the remaining candidates, or to "No Confidence" as needed, by next active choice ranked.

#.  Any proposed amendment to these bylaws must be put to a vote at a regular meeting of Student Senate one (1) to three (3) weeks after its initial presentation to Student Senate.
    1.  To be adopted, the amendment must receive a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority vote of approval at this regular Student Senate meeting.

Student Senate may instead put the proposed amendment to a vote at the same meeting as its initial presentation on the basis of a three-fourths (3/4) supermajority vote in favor of such action. In such cases it is required that the proposed amendment be provided, via e-mail, to Student Senate at least one (1) week prior to its initial presentation to Senate.

# Appendix A: Definition of the Droop Quota for Single Transferable Vote Elections

The Droop quota will be used to assign the number of votes needed to be elect a candidate in a Single Transferable Vote election for a vacant Student Senator seat. The value is equal to the total value of valid votes cast divided by the sum of one plus the number of seats to be filled, plus one. Expressed mathematically, this is equivalent to the [total value of valid votes / (1 + number of vacant seats)] + 1.


# Appendix B: Amendments to the Student Senate Bylaws

_Note: In September 2009 the Amendment procedure for the Student Senate Bylaws was changed to require that amendments be kept as an appendix to these bylaws. A partial list of amendments from March 19th, 1998 onward was available, and so it has also been included in this appendix. In April 2010 major revisions to the Student Senate Bylaws were approved by Student Senate, effectively replacing the old document with a new set of bylaws, and a separate document detailing Student Senate Fiscal Policy. The details of these changes are not included in this appendix, but all changes made to this document after the major revisions are recorded in this appendix._
